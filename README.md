## Troubleshooting

- When chaging an icon for another of the same name sometimes a metadata refresh (with new images and/or server restart might be needed, not much i can do about that.
- For icons to show on TV show posters ALL episodes must contain the same language audio and/or subtitles.
- You need to supply your own icons. 
- Verify the icon folder path contains correctly named PNG icons for your languages.  
- Library names might need quotetation marks around them on some systems eg. "Movies". I'm looking into this.
- Ensure media files have proper language tags on audio and subtitle streams.
